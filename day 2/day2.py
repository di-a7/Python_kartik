# Variables - container that store data 

# print('Hello World Hello WorldHello World Hello World Hello World')
# print('Hello World Hello WorldHello World Hello World Hello World')

# Rules to followed while creating identifiers
# first letter must not be digit 1helloo
# no space inbetween identifiers myVarible
# Case sensitive. eg: myvariable and myVarible thess are different 
# _ can be used to create identifiers
# keyword cant be used as identifiers

# name_12 = 'Diya'
# name = 'Dia'

# print(name_12)
# print(Name)

#Pascal Case - first letters of the variable are capital
# MyVarible, FirstName, MyFirstName

#Snake - using underscore
# my_varible, my_first_name

# Camel case - varible 1st letter of word is small and aaru word ko 1st letter capital
#  myVaribles, myFirstName

# myVaribl = 'abc'
# print(myVariable)

#DATATYPE

# c = 'hello world\'s'
# d = "hello world's"
# print(c)

#Squence datetype
# list - ordered, mutable
# fruits = ["apple","mango","mango", 12, 52, 85, [1,54,"abcd"]]
# print(fruits)

# tuple - ordered, not mutable
# food = ("abc","bakdj",25,56,)
# food = tuple(["apple","mango","mango", 12, 52, 85, [1,54,"abcd"]])
# print(food)

# Set - unordered, cannot have duplicate data
# s = {"Mindrisers","is","Mindrisers"}
# print(s)

# Dictionary - key-value pair
# d = {1:"diya",2:"200"}
# print(d)
