# logical operator
a = 5

# and operator  - both condition should be then output is true 
# z = a < b and c < d
# print(z)

# or operator - output ture if any one condtion is true
# p = a > b or c > d
# print(p)

# not operator - output True if condition is false and vise versa
# a = True 
# print(not a)
